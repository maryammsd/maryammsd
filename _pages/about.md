I am currently a dual-degree PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and Sharif University of Technology supervised by Professor Charles Zhang and Dr. Amini. Before that, I received my Master degree from the Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology in 2016, supervised by Dr. Mehdi Kharrazi. Currently, my research is about using fuzzing techniques for crash reproduction in Android applications.
